# ToDo API

A RESTful ToDo API built with Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Docker, featuring full CRUD operations. The project demonstrates modern backend development practices, containerisation, and deployment via Nginx reverse proxy.

## Features

- ✅ Create, Read, Update, Delete ToDo items
- ✅ Dynamic Postman tests for all endpoints
- ✅ PostgreSQL database persistence
- ✅ Fully containerized with Docker and Docker Compose
- ✅ Deployed behind an Nginx reverse proxy
- ✅ Live demo available

## Tech Stack

-   **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL
-   **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
-   **Reverse Proxy:** Nginx
-   **Testing:** Postman (with automated environment variables and dynamic test data)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Docker & Docker Compose installed
-   Java 17+ (for local development without Docker)
-   Git

## Running the Project Locally

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git)
    cd your-repo
    ```

2.  **Build and run with Docker Compose**

    Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed. Then, from the project's root directory, run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This command will start both required services:
    -   The Spring Boot API
    -   The PostgreSQL database

3.  **Access the API**

    Once the containers are running, you can access the API endpoints at:
    `http://localhost:8081/api/todo`

### Stopping the Containers

To stop and remove the running containers, use the following command:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint         | Description                  |
| :----- | :--------------- | :--------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/api/todo`      | Retrieve all ToDo items      |
| `GET`  | `/api/todo/{id}` | Retrieve a ToDo by ID        |
| `POST` | `/api/todo`      | Create a new ToDo item       |
| `PUT`  | `/api/todo/{id}` | Update an existing ToDo item |
| `DELETE`|`/api/todo/{id}` | Delete a ToDo item           |

## Postman Testing

The project includes automated Postman tests to verify all API endpoints.

-   Import `ToDo.postman_collection.json` into Postman.
-   Set up a Postman environment with `{{baseUrl}}` pointing to your API URL, or import my environment from  `postman/ToDo-API-Env.json` (this tests my domain name so replace with yours). 
-   The tests dynamically generate titles and validate CRUD operations.
-   Run the collection to verify API functionality.

## Testing

This project includes comprehensive **unit tests** for the service layer of the ToDo application, ensuring the core business logic behaves correctly.  

### Test Coverage

![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/Coverage-71%25-brightgreen)

The project achieves **71% test coverage** as measured by JaCoCo. The coverage focuses primarily on the service layer, which contains all the business logic, including:

- Retrieving all tasks
- Adding tasks with duplicate title validation
- Updating tasks with partial field changes and validation
- Deleting tasks safely only if they exist
- Retrieving tasks by ID with proper error handling

The **unit tests** use **JUnit 5** and **Mockito** to mock the repository layer, isolating the service logic and verifying expected behavior.

### Testing Strategy

- **Positive tests:** Verify correct behavior when expected inputs are provided (e.g., successfully adding a new task or updating fields correctly).  
- **Negative tests:** Verify the application correctly handles invalid or edge-case scenarios (e.g., attempting to add a duplicate task or deleting a non-existent task).  
- **ArgumentCaptor usage:** Ensures the service passes the correct objects to the repository during save operations.  

### Excluded from Unit Tests

- **Controller layer:** Not directly unit-tested because the project already has **full integration tests via Postman** that verify the REST API endpoints behave correctly. Adding controller tests would largely duplicate these integration tests without adding value.  
- **Configuration class (`ToDoConfig`) and model class (`ToDo`):** These classes contain no business logic. The configuration is automatically executed by Spring Boot, and the model is a simple data structure, so unit testing them is unnecessary.

## Deployment

The API is deployed using Docker and Docker Compose.
-   PostgreSQL runs as a separate container.
-   Nginx reverse proxy handles domain routing, enabling multiple services on the same server.
-   **Live demo:** `http://ozgur-todo.mooo.com/api/todo`

---

## Notes

-   Every `POST` request generates a dynamic title for testing purposes.
-   Error handling for deleted or missing resources can be improved (404 responses are tested in Postman).
-   Postman tests ensure that all endpoints behave as expected, even with dynamic input.
